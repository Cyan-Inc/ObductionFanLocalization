# ObductionFanLocalization
Localized changes to the game Obduction.

Hello there!
Thank you so much for your interest in contributing localization support for a new language in Obduction!
Feel free to fork our repository and make a pull request in adherance to the [standards listed in our FAQ](https://github.com/Cyan-Inc/ObductionFanLocalization/wiki/FAQ#what-information-or-data-do-i-need-to-include-in-my-pull-request), and some are listed here for reference:
### I want to localize files from Obduction into a new language. How do I go about doing this?
1. In your game's `Obduction/Content/Localization` directory, add a new directory for your language named as two letters that are generally used as describing your language name (e.g. "fr" would be two characters that in general use, symbolize "French").
2. Copy and paste all of the files from the `en` directory into your new language.
3. Add a new language entry in your `Languages.json` file (in the `Localization` directory) with a `LanguageID` that is the same as the name of the directory you just created (that is how the localization manager in the game finds your files), a `LanguageName` that is the English translation of your language name, and a `DisplayName` that is the name of your language in your language.
4. Open Obduction and verify that your language appears in the languages list in the menu. If it is not listed in the languages list, double check that you entered everything in the `Languages.json` file correctly.
5. Start translating files in your new language's directory and be sure to check that they work in-game. Please note that all files must be saved with an encoding of UTF-16 LE with BOM.
6. Once all of your files are translated and have been verified as displaying correctly in the game, you can make a pull request into this repository with that folder you created.

### I'm unfamiliar with GitHub, but I would like to contribute a language I've localized for Obduction by making this so-called "Pull request". How can I share my work with you?
1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Visit [our repository's Localization directory](https://github.com/Cyan-Inc/ObductionFanLocalization/tree/master/Localization).
3. Click on the "Upload Files" button that is sitting just above the "latest commit" message, near the top right of the screen.
4. Drag the folder on your disk that contains your new language's localized files into the area that says "Drag files here".
5. Once you have done that, scroll down and enter in a title and commit message for your commit.
6. When you have added your title and commit message in accordance to our README, click on "Create Pull Request".
7. On the page you are brought to when creating a pull request, ensure that the base fork (the fork on the left) is the `Obduction Fan Localization` repo and the branch next to it is `master`.
8. Ensure that your title and commit message are good enough to submit, and then press "Create a Pull Request" again.
9. For more information on using GitHub and creating pull requests, see [GitHub's start-up guide.](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
